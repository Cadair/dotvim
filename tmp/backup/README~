There are two gif animations with both of the cameras, one higher
quality (much better).

    + anim_11_7_06c_hi.gif
    + anim_11_7_06c_low,gif

There are also gif animations for the individual cameras (both 2000px).

    + anim_11_7_06c_cam1.gif
    + anim_11_7_06c_cam2.gif

The source.tar.gz archive contains
    
    + the script used to convert to gif and make the animations
    + the original single camera images in cam1/ and cam2/
    + joined up images in presentation/
    
The top of the animations contains text with the run parameters.

    + h_1 is the fractional interface depth
    + rho_0 is the relative density of the current
    + rho_1 is the relative density of the lower layer
    + rho_0 (typo! should be rho_2) is the relative density of the 
      upper layer which is 1 as it's water anyway.
    + alpha = (rho_0 - rho_1) / (rho_1 - rho_2) is the parameter that
      I vary. Call it the buoyancy ratio.
    + D is the fractional initial depth of the current. There are runs
      with this equal to 1 as well.

Roughly, a difference in density of 0.10 corresponds to a 10K potential
temperature (virtual, strictly) difference in the atmosphere.

There is parallax in the images, but this is corrected for in post-processing.

This work differs from e.g. Tan et al (2010) in that it looks in
depth at subscritical behaviour (like the example run here).

Rottman and Simpson (1989) considered a two layer system with a very
shallow lower layer, more like a nocturnal / marine inversion.
