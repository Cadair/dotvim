Style Sheets for Markdown
=========================

Markdown is really useful for writing content without worrying
about marking it up. However, the raw html generated by markdown
looks naff - it uses the default font and text is spread over the
full width of the page which makes it very difficult to read on a
modern screen.

Vanilla Markdown
----------------

There are lots of tools for maintaining a blog with markdown
content (e.g. [Jekyll][], WordPress) but I wanted something much 
simpler.  Luckily, Kevin Burke has already talked about exactly this 
[issue][burke]. The [solution] is to add a single line to the start
of the Markdown file, with a link to some stylesheet address

    <p><link href="http://kevinburke.bitbucket.org/markdowncss/markdown.css" rel="stylesheet"></link></p>

[Jekyll]: https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll
[burke]: http://kev.inburke.com/kevin/markdown-css-help-make-the-web-prettier/
[solution]: http://kevinburke.bitbucket.org/markdowncss

Previous to reading this I had a very vague idea of what css did.
Now I have an only slightly less vague idea, but I've been able to
use it functionally.

To avoid tarnishing the start of the raw Markdown files it is best
if this line of code isn't kept in the file itself. It can either be
prepended to the html file after generation or prepended to a temporary
copy of the markdown file - both things that can be scripted.

MultiMarkdown
-------------

I'm using [MultiMarkdown][mmd] to render my Markdown documents.
MultiMarkdown produces 'snippets' of html by default, i.e. not
complete html documents. They will still render fine in most
web browsers, but don't contain metadata. If we provide metadata
to MultiMarkdown it will automatically generate complete html, 
and this includes specifying things like **CSS**.

With MultiMarkdown, you just have
    
    CSS: http://somelinkto/stylesheet.css

at the start of the document. Other metadata can be specified,
e.g. Author, Affiliation, Date, Title and some LaTex specific
ones (MultiMarkdown renders LaTex too).

Because this metadata is much more pleasing to look at than the
html line at the beginning and because it serves a useful purpose
it isn't so much of a problem including it at the start of the 
Markdown file.

Bash doesn't have a prepend function, but it is quite easy
to combine a header and main file
